              Hi, I'm Leo Yang and my Chinese name is
              <span className="whitespace-nowrap"> 杨凌宇</span>
              . I am a software engineer with a passion for capturing moments through the lens as a photographer.

            In the world of software engineering, I have had the privilege of working on diverse projects, ranging from full-stack web applications to Machine Learning. 
            My love for problem-solving and coding has driven me to continuously expand my skill set, ensuring that I stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends in the industry. 
            The thrill of creating innovative solutions to real-world problems is what motivates me every day in my professional journey.

            Beyond the realm of coding, I find solace and inspiration in the art of photography. 
            Photography allows me to express my creativity and capture the beauty of the world around us. 
            Whether it's a vibrant cityscape, the serenity of nature, or the candid expressions on people's faces, 
            I cherish the ability to freeze these moments in time and share them with others.
